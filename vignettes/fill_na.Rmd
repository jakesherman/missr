The `fill_na` function is used to fill in, or replace, NAs with values. `fill_na` 
works on the most common data structures in R: data.frames, matricies, lists, vectors, and data.tables. Let's start by going over how `fill_na` works on data.frames, the most common use case.

## Data.frames

`fill_na` is designed to work with the magrittr pipe `%>%`, so the first argument, `.data`, is always the object that you want to fill in NAs for. The second argument, `.fill`, may be one of three things:

1. A value to fill in NAs with. Only columns in the data.frame of the same type as that value (identified via the `identify_type` function)
